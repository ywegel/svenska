# Svenska

**Svenska** is a work-in-progress Android app for learning Swedish vocabulary.

Features in progress:
- Add and organize vocabulary with translations, grammar info, notes, and favorites.
- Quiz mode to test your vocabulary knowledge.
- Bonus material for topics like numbers and word groups.
- Support for importing vocabulary from textbook tables.
- Python scripts (existing and planned) to extract vocabulary from learning resources, which can then be loaded into the app via the importer.
- Possible future migration to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to support iOS and desktop.

More updates and documentation coming soon!
